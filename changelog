
Some important changes:

--------Xidel 0.9.8 --------
(2018-04-02)
- Cookie handling follows RFC 6265 rather than sending all cookies to all servers.
- add t:siblings-header/siblings elements to pattern matcher to match certain element siblings regardless of their ordering (e.g. table columns).
- add functions x:call-action, x:has-action, x:get-log, x:clear-log to give programmatic access to multipage templates and variable changelog.
- add --module, --module-path parameters to load XQuery modules into (xpath) queries and properly resolve relative paths for module imports.
- fix system(), file:exists, file:move (override), file:path-to-uri on Windows
- further minor bug fixes and performance improvements

--------Xidel 0.9.6 --------
(2016-11-20)
* add function x:request for HTTP or follow-like requests inside a query
* new functions: x:argc, x:argv, x:integer, x:integer-to-base
* fix that entities were not decoded, if --output-encoding was not set
* better default encoding settings when converting between Windows terminal encoding and utf8 for piped files
* a new JSON parser with two distinct modes: input formats json/json-strict for accepting/rejecting invalid JSON
* JSON output is prettified.
* An xquery version declaration disables all extension unless a version code like "3.0-xidel" or "3.0-jsoniq" is used. #!xidel in the first line is ignored, so it can be used for executable XQuery scripts.
* various fixes, performance improvements and internal restructuring

--------Xidel 0.9.4 --------
(2016-06-08)

* completes the support for XQuery 3.0 and XPath 3.0, e.g. functions format-*, math:* functions
* uses a new underlying regular expression engine, FLRE, which supports Unicode, \p,\c,\i character classes and is supposed to be extremely fast
* stricter error conditions, invalid XPath queries that were previously evaluated are now rejected, for example
  in regular expressions (?i) or \b, (1 + if(..) then ...) instead of (1 + (if(..) then ...)),  gYear("123") instead of gYear("0123")
* this improves the XQuery Test Suite conformance and it passes basically 100% of the XPath 2 tests and over 99.5% of the XQuery 3 tests
* supports the EXPath file module to write or read local files
* custom functions: random($max), random-seed(), x:product($seq)
* new multipage template statements: <try><catch>, <else>
* the error raising HTTP codes are now customizable
* the headers of the last HTTP request can be accessed via $headers
* improved debugging facilities: Evaluation tracing, colored output, improved error messages
* the default data model for primitive types is now XML Schema 1.1 and Unicode 8.0 conformant
* boolean operations are short-cut evaluated
* --quiet/-q was renamed to --silent/-s
* check for XIDEL_OPTIONS environment variable
* various fixes and performance improvements

--------Xidel 0.9--------
(2015-06-28)

* support of more XQuery 3 expressions and functions:
  - anonymous functions, higher order function, function references, function tests
  - new flwor clauses: group by, tumbling and sliding window, count, allowing empty
  - try+catch expressions
  - URI qualified names, e.g. Q{http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/}foo instead xmlns:foo
  - fn:unparsed-text, parse-xml, environment-variable, path, round#2, string-join#1, fn:serialize ...
* change output format of variables, type annotations, line separators and stderr-information
* add support for multipart form requests and file uploads via a --form parameter
* Add custom functions pxp:transform  and pxp:request-combine
* fix some issues with non ascii characters in cli arguments
* fix raw data/url after --follow=... arguments and multiple --follow with form requests
* fix some HTML parsing bugs
* fix a large number of XPath/XQuery compatibility bugs.


--------Xidel 0.8.4--------

* implementing all syntax extensions described in my Balisage talk:
  - adding pattern matching in let, for, typeswitch expressions
  - different matching modes for attributes
* support for custom headers on the command line
* can import environment variables
* changed html encoding detection to give content-type highest priority
* fix nested forwarding in recursive calls
* fix crashes/exceptions

--------Xidel 0.8--------

* improved JSONiq extension support
  * updated to the new 1.0.3 standard. Most important: () operator to list object keys / unbox arrays, {| .. |} syntax for object merging, relaxed behaviour on sequences
  * changed my dot notation to behave like the dot operator in JSONiq standalone, i.e. disabled the $var.property syntax, but added $var."property" 
  * fix object with keys containing a dot (.)
  * fix parsing of null in json input
* Use arbitrary precision arithmetic for all numeric operations
* Some minor XPath/XQuery 3 syntax: ! and || operators, and switch statement
* new elements in multipage template: <if>, <choose>, <when>, <otherwise> similar to XSLT, <s> to evaluate short XQuery expressions like in singlepage templates  
* allow template:optional flag on all template elements
* improved html form/url handling: input elements can be passed to pxp:form to create their url encoded post data, uri-decode/uri-encode/uri-combine functions to modify urls, resolve-html function that resolves references in html elements (e.g. @src when passed <img>) to the base uri
* more := shenanigans: $var[] := appends to sequences, $sequence[index] := assigns to sequence elements, $array(index) := assigns to array elements, $var(property) := assigns to object properties. Can be combined, so e.g. $array(index)[] inserts in arrays. Assigning () removes elements
* handle <base>-Element for resolving relative links
* Handle hex encoded password in urls
* other minor improvements and bug fixes


--------Xidel 0.7--------

* Improved handling of extract/follow command line chains:
  Following occurs in depth-first-search
  Brackets [ ] can be used to group arguments together (e.g. [ -f //a -e //title ] to read the titles of all pages linked on the current page, without changing the current page)

* The old json/xml output formats are now called json-wrapped and xml-wrapped
* Added html and xml output formats, which will just print the elements in their format 
  with the respective headers  
* Added bash output format to export the variables to the shell (e.g. eval $(xidel --output-format bash ...))

* Fix a few xml/html parsing and serialization bugs (e.g. added closing tags for <link>)
* Added an option to print elements as html, instead as xml

* Added support for JSONiq: e.g. object syntax {"a": 123}("a"), arrays [10,20,30](1), the JSONiq jn:* functions,
  additional pxp:json() and pxp:serialize-json functions to parse/serialize JSON

* Added outer-html, inner-html functions to the XPath engine which will serialize the element
  in a string

* The syntax extension of variable inclusion in strings like "$foo;" was replaced by prefixed strings x"{$foo}", the regex extraction function pxp:filter was renamed to pxp:extract, to avoid confusion with the XQuery 3 fn:filter function

* Added support for different http request methods (e.g. PUT), basic authentication, allow arbitrary ports

* Added a system function to run arbitrary commands, a $raw variable containing the raw data of the current page

* Improved detection of CSS/XPath/XQuery kind expressions, also added --css, --xpath, --xquery parameters to easily bypass the detection

* Various other changes

--------Xidel 0.6--------

* Full XQuery 1 support (except XML schema and static type checking, but these are XQuery optional features)

* Added a match function to perform pattern matching between XML documents
* Added a form function to convert a html form in a http request

* Handle '-single quotes in Windows command line
* Support for Windows console OEM encoding

* Fix a few XPath 2 interpreter bugs (e.g. wrong namespace for functions)

--------Xidel 0.5--------
